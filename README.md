## Hi there, I'm Nowshin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science Graduate in Canada, currently improving my **data engineering** knowledge. In this profile, I regularly update my learning journey. 

I am open to Remote or Hybrid Roles, Internships and Part time opportunities.

### ðŸ”­ Currently Learning 
I am currently doing an end-to-end data engineering project using an e-commerce dataset [(repository link)](https://github.com/nna01/Data-Engeering-Brazil-Ecommerce). So, far I have 
- Created the data model (ERD) through analyzing the dataset
- Created a database following the ERD and loaded the data using PostgreSQL
- Transformed the original ERD to Snowflake Schema
- Implemented the Snowflake Schema using PostgreSQL
- Wrote a Python Script to extract, transform, and load the data from Original database to the Snowflake schema database


### ðŸŒ± Learned so far 
- Concepts and implementation of **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) using Python and SQL scripts. 
- Deploying data pipeline on **Airflow** and **AWS S3**
  

### âœ¨ Certifications Earned  âœ¨
